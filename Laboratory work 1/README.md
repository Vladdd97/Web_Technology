# Laboratory work 1
## About theme
 I've chosen to make a movie site where you can find films and cartoons to watch. 
 On this site you will also be able to sort movies by categories and rate them .
 ## Pages
This site has 5 pages :
 - Most popular - there you can find most popular films and cartoons on the site
 - Movie - there you can sort movies by categories and choose the one you like
 - Cartoons - there you can find all available cartoons
 - Sign in 
 - Sign up
> For now I didn't put a lot of content on my site because I will do that in the future laboratory works using a database .
## Conclusion
- I have used Bootstrap 4 framework for building my site .
- Due to Bootstrap grid system I made site be responsive .
>  I put bootstrap 4 files in my project because I do not have permanent access to internet 
>  and in that way for me is more comfortable to use bootstrap 4 and work on laboratory work.
